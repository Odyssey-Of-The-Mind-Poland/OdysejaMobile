  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/graphics/ootm_logo.png
    - assets/graphics/x2/ootm_logo.png
    - assets/graphics/x3/ootm_logo.png
    - assets/graphics/x4/ootm_logo.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family:  OotmIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/OotmIcons.ttf
    - family: Ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-BoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 700

        - asset: assets/fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-MediumItalic.ttf
